                        <summary>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</summary>
                        <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but would not be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw about
                            16,000 kilograms on a trans-lunar injection orbit, so it can send a Dragon 2 capsule to the moon with quite a lot of margin. However, in order to land on a surface, you need to slow down from orbital velocity, which requires a significant change in velocity (∆V). Dragon 2 can only deliver a small amount of ∆V, so it cannot land on the moon without additional technology development.</p>

                        <summary>What is Red Dragon?</summary>
                        <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander and could carry up to 2 metric tons of cargo. However, there have been no official announcements or funding for this mission.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</summary>
                        <p>No, Dragon is too cramped and would need significant improvements to support astronauts for the long journey to Mars. Elon Musk has stated that Dragon 2 is designed for short-term missions of "several days," not for long-duration space travel.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Why does the dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</summary>
                        <p>The Dragon capsule has a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port rather than a NASA Docking System (NDS). Berthing requires manual intervention with a robotic arm, while docking is autonomous. While berthing is slower, it allows for a larger interface, which is advantageous for cargo capacity.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</summary>
                        <p>No, Dragon 1 is not equipped for quick evacuation. It is used for cargo missions and cannot be used as an escape pod for astronauts in emergencies, as it does not have seats or the required safety systems for human evacuation.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</summary>
                        <p>No, Dragon does not have the fuel capacity to reboost the ISS. The SuperDraco engines are too powerful, and the vehicle lacks the necessary systems to safely perform such a maneuver.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</summary>
                        <p>The Dragon 2 has a delta-v of approximately 420 m/s, which is sufficient for its mission requirements. This figure was derived based on the weight of the capsule and the specific impulse of the SuperDraco engines.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</summary>
                        <p>If a SuperDraco thruster fails, Dragon 2 is capable of safely landing using its remaining thrusters and parachutes. In case of a failure, parachutes would deploy, and the capsule would splash down in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</summary>
                        <p>No, SuperDraco and Draco are designed for different uses. Draco engines are used for small in-orbit maneuvers, while SuperDraco engines provide powerful thrust for landing and escape scenarios.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</summary>
                        <p>PICA-X is an improved version of the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA), which SpaceX uses for heat shields. It is designed for reuse and ablates very little compared to other materials, making it an ideal material for Dragon missions.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</summary>
                        <p>Technically, yes, but economically, it wouldn't be feasible. It would be cheaper to design and launch a new space telescope rather than modify Dragon 2 for this purpose.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</summary>
                        <p>During an abort, the trunk helps stabilize the capsule and prevents it from flipping. The trunk provides aerodynamic stability, making sure that the capsule remains oriented correctly after the abort is initiated.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</summary>
                        <p>The Dragon capsule enters the atmosphere by firing its Draco thrusters for deorbit. After jettisoning the trunk, the capsule enters the atmosphere with its heat shield facing forward. Parachutes are deployed at lower altitudes to slow the capsule down for a safe splashdown in the ocean.</p>
