<div class="article"> Thoughts on Web Accessiblity  
  <p><b> September 25th, 2024</b></p>

  <p>
    Web accessibility is what allows our website to be accessible to everyone. It's important because first of all it is
    legal requirement. But beyond that it is the <em>right</em> thing to do. I have appreciated how much accessibility
    has come up in my college experience right now. One lecture in my first year experience class the other day visiting
    professor William Cox highlighted that one of the issues with solving problems is the laws that are in place, it is
    not really enough. He stated as an example that to comply with ADA requirements to a building you have to have a
    ramp to make it wheelchair accessible. But it does not indicate where this ramp has to be placed. It could be placed
    where the user has to go all the way around to the back of the building. True accessibility gives everyone the same
    access and opportunity.
  </p>
  <p> From the video: "Accessibility in the modern web" it took my understanding of web accessibility even further. My
    limited understanding thought our website would just make navigation and accessibility harder for some people. But I
    came to realize It has the potential to make it impossible to accomplish the same task "click the button" with no
    option allowing you to press the spacebar on a keyboard as an example. I find this an incredibly irritating thing. I
    think back to times on the web I thought something was of poor design. Example: date of birth calendar that makes
    you click though every single month you have been alive to get to your date of birth. That is frustrating but if I
    was not able to fill that in at all or click on it I would be really upset. That is taking a task I am perfectly
    capable of doing on my own but due to poor design I now have to take extra steps of reaching out to someone. I have
    to consider whether the product or service is even worth it at that point. </p>

  <q>Web accessibility essential for some, useful for all</q> â€“ W3C Web accessibility initiative (WAI)
  <p>The video series from w3c on "website accessible prospectives" videos were super helpful in easily highlighting
    what the issue or limitation might be and why it is thus important to make sure that the accessibility is in place.
  </p>


  It had videos on the following topics:
  <ul>
    <li>Keyboard Compatibility</li>

    <li>Video Captions</li>

    <li>Colors with good contrast.</li>

    <li>Customizable text </li>

    <li>Clear layout and design </li>

    <li>Speech recognition </li>

    <li>Understandable content</li>

    <li>Large links, buttons and controls.</li>

    <li>Notifications and feedback.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>From that list I really could relate to the clear layout and design. It helps me understand that we all have a sort
    of expectation on how things are layed out. It reminds me when I worked as a server and was told that the salt is
    always on the right and pepper on the left for those that are visually impaired. They have an expectation of where
    the salt should be. I can appreciate that while I have not always had the understanding of how things should be it
    really does make sense that things have more thought and meaning put into it. So from this assignment I have found
    the ideas we have been talking about in class makes sense: It has legal implications, it's the right thing to do and
    makes financial sense for a company regardless if someone needs a specific accessibility feature or not.</p>
