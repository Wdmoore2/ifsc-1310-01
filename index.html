  <b>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</b>
 <p><b> November 25th, 2024</b></p>
</div>
</section>
<p> Progressive enhancement focuses on content first and making it available to all. It differs from grateful degradation that focused on only the newer technology thus it was not always as accessible. I remember when the mobile web was relatively new and I had to go to the bottom of the page and find the mobile version of the page. The full site was way to big and did not show up well on my blackberry. I like that progressive enhancement focuses on the content first and making it availble to everyone. When we consider Progressive enhancement the web article on understanding progressive enhancement compares it to a Peanut M&M. The concept starts with the Content (HTML), it adds CSS for the presentation layer. and then makes it come alive with JavaScript. The article mentions that the use of java script "makes it come alive". I always picture the newspapers in Harry Potter where the photo is a live photo it's more alive than regular newspaper.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-enhancement/">WebFX Progressive Enhancement Blog Article</a></p>
<p> The above article puts progressive this way "Seperation of HTML,CSS, and Java Script.That’s it, really. If you had to remember one thing about progressive enhancement, it should be that." The Blog post goes on to mention all the benifits in regards to Accessiblity, Portablity, Modulatity, and Site Performance. From that blog as well I like that it does acknowledge that there is more work initially to learn and use prinicples in progressive enhancement. But the payoff is worth the investment as you now have a website that everyone can use and can have a more powerful reach to your target audience whether they be a mobile user or desktop user. </p>

  <b> Dragon Project Revision and Reflection (Coming Soon) </b>
  <p><b> December 2nd,2024</b></p>
  </section>
  <p> Upon completion of my first draft I called upon an old friend Devin Page – a firefighter living in Maumelle to give feedback on my project. Devin is one to offer constructive feedback and I likewise do the same with him in various areas of life.</p>
  <p> I received the following feedback: "Something I look for on informative websites are things that break up the monotony. Bigger words, Brighter colors, maybe some interaction pop ups would be cool. I do like the FAQS and having the answers on the same pages. Some relevant videos would also help"  
  </p>
  <p>Upon receiving this feedback I was thankful that the prospective gave me something to work on and was not a simply I like this. Devin gave me 4 things to address from a design prospective:  

    <li>Font size ( I will add looking into a better font type in general here)   </li>
    
    <li>Brighter Colors </li> 
    
   <li> Pop up Interactions </li> 
    
    <li>Videos</li>
    
      </p>

  <p>I am seeking to implement at least 3 of these into my design. I am debating on whether I will implement number 3 as I picture ads and things that have been talked about not as favorable in class as a design prospective but have been used as revenue source that Mr.Wallace has frowned upon in resorting to in website development. I think that a practice could be beneficial of this design element and I may use it to prompt some kind of engagement on the site. Maybe a survey questions form that displays results of others who have used it. Something simple like a multiple choice question such as "What attracts you to space travel" and then engaging the user to answer and see how many would agree with their position. I will say at the time of my writing this I am not sure of the feasibility of that into my design.   </p>
  <p> I strived to add bigger font, Added my Java script in the form of a image carousel on the Missions page. Added a couple of videos to the home page and the missions page that was relevant. I ultimately decided against any pop ups on the page.   </p>
  <p>This semester was an exciting and productive first semester. I really appreciated how from the  start Mr. Wallace emphasized what the expectations were that you show up, be prepared for conversations by doing the assigned readings, Engage and ask questions and complete the work and the A will come standard to you in class. What I did really well was showing up, I tried to think about other questions I had and sent them Mr. Wallace way and he had the answers and if he did not or the topic was more in-depth he gave me great starting points to explore the topic some more.  Things I would go back on would be my understanding of CSS selectors. I understand the concept from a very baseline view and can target an attribute but I know I have some disconnect with what I am capable of with the CSS. I also noticed that I felt I was really struggling with the design elements. I know Mr. Wallace asked us to have some grace as we are not going to be graphic designers in a week but it feels like in some ways others may be more artistically inclined naturally whereas I feel like my path will be through more theory of art and working hard to become that person to see and match artistic ability. That was a struggle to come to grips with... I had to accept that what I did with the vector project and the bear design project was the best with the information given from class and kicking the tires on the project was enough to be considered a honest attempt for credit on the work performed in those regards.   </p>
  <p> Another thing that can be said about what I would do if I had to start over is utilizing classmates and collaborating more early on. I did get a classmate that I now text more and we can throw ideas back and forth and talk about class with but I would have liked earlier on to have studied with someone toward the start. Where my focus instead shifted was on completing tasks and I found an additional take away from a volunteer project in FYE class of being able to do tech tutoring. Through that tech tutoring I met others that went through web technologies and ones that were needing some assistance currently. I also saw how some don't follow instructions and as a result got very behind ( I am thankful to see as he continued tutoring with another Trojan tutor after an initial session with me he was able to have consistent tutoring sessions to keep him accountable and it is my understanding he was able to catch up in web technologies class)  

    I say all of the following that while I look back and see some what ifs I could have done differently I don't focus on them extensively because this semester was a very good semester with lots of growth, or as I learned in your class "Progressive Enhancement".  </p>

<div class="article"> Thoughts on Web Accessibility  
  <p><b> September 25th, 2024</b></p>
</div>
</section>
</section>
  <p>
    Web accessibility is what allows our website to be accessible to everyone. It's important because first of all it is
    legal requirement. But beyond that it is the <em>right</em> thing to do. I have appreciated how much accessibility
    has come up in my college experience right now. One lecture in my first year experience class the other day visiting
    professor William Cox highlighted that one of the issues with solving problems is the laws that are in place, it is
    not really enough. He stated as an example that to comply with ADA requirements to a building you have to have a
    ramp to make it wheelchair accessible. But it does not indicate where this ramp has to be placed. It could be placed
    where the user has to go all the way around to the back of the building. True accessibility gives everyone the same
    access and opportunity.
  </p>
  <p> From the video: "Accessibility in the modern web" it took my understanding of web accessibility even further. My
    limited understanding thought our website would just make navigation and accessibility harder for some people. But I
    came to realize It has the potential to make it impossible to accomplish the same task "click the button" with no
    option allowing you to press the spacebar on a keyboard as an example. I find this an incredibly irritating thing. I
    think back to times on the web I thought something was of poor design. Example: date of birth calendar that makes
    you click though every single month you have been alive to get to your date of birth. That is frustrating but if I
    was not able to fill that in at all or click on it I would be really upset. That is taking a task I am perfectly
    capable of doing on my own but due to poor design I now have to take extra steps of reaching out to someone. I have
    to consider whether the product or service is even worth it at that point. </p>

    <div id="video-container"></div>

  <q>Web accessibility essential for some, useful for all</q> – W3C Web accessibility initiative (WAI)
  <p>The video series from w3c on "website accessible prospectives" videos were super helpful in easily highlighting
    what the issue or limitation might be and why it is thus important to make sure that the accessibility is in place.
  </p>


  It had videos on the following topics:
  <ul>
    <li>Keyboard Compatibility</li>

    <li>Video Captions</li>

    <li>Colors with good contrast.</li>

    <li>Customizable text </li>

    <li>Clear layout and design </li>

    <li>Speech recognition </li>

    <li>Understandable content</li>

    <li>Large links, buttons and controls.</li>

    <li>Notifications and feedback.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>From that list I really could relate to the clear layout and design. It helps me understand that we all have a sort
    of expectation on how things are layed out. It reminds me when I worked as a server and was told that the salt is
    always on the right and pepper on the left for those that are visually impaired. They have an expectation of where
    the salt should be. I can appreciate that while I have not always had the understanding of how things should be it
    really does make sense that things have more thought and meaning put into it. So from this assignment I have found
    the ideas we have been talking about in class makes sense: It has legal implications, it's the right thing to do and
    makes financial sense for a company regardless if someone needs a specific accessibility feature or not.</p>
