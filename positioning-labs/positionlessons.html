  <h1>Issues with positioning lab at EOD on October 21st, 2024:</h1>
 <body>
<ul> 
  <li> Issues noticed when I adjusted the screen</li>
  <li> As soon as I got use to Float - Absolute completly flipped the script.</li>
  <li> Laptop was not harmed in production of this lab. (I may have had to apologize for my verbals to it)</li>
  <li> I noticed I was mixing up the rules of float with the values of absolute position. I was resorting to using negative numbers in my code before I figured out was going on.  </li>
    <li> Would like to research more infomation on sizing the page. I can see a value in sketching layout with values ahead of time.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> October 22nd, 2024 - Second visit to the labs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> investigated inspect element just a little more. Need to look more into computed value for the space</li>
  <li> Seemed to have fixed Exercise 4 but still don't understand how enough to apply it to Exercise 3 </li>
  <li> I feel like there is a big lesson on this activity on caution with absolute positioning. </li>
  <li> I don't understand why the page is not adjusting as I adjust the window. I am assuming this may have to do with the media queries and forse the view but have ran out of time tonight to investigate / revisit that concept to adjust. </li>
  </ul>
